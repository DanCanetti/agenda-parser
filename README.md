# Event Agenda Parser

Parse a JSON file into a basic responsive event agenda. [View demo](https://agenda-parser.danielcanetti.com/).

### Usage

I've included an example CSV in the project, fill in the timings and details of each talk and convert to a JSON file. Call the JSON file from the parse-csv.js script and this will create the agenda.

### To do

- Create option for multiple days
- Clean up styling
- Add favicon
- Split files into demo and src
- Only show file uploader if Webpack in development mode
