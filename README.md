# Event Agenda Parser

Parse a JSON file into a basic responsive event agenda.

### Usage

I've included an example CSV in the project, fill in the timings and details of each talk and convert to a JSON file. Call the JSON file from the parse-csv.js script and this will create the agenda.

### To do

- Automatically parse JSON file
- Create option for multiple days
- Clean up styling
- Add favicon
