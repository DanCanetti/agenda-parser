# Event Agenda/Timeline Parser

Parse a CSV file into a basic responsive event agenda. [View demo](https://agenda-parser.danielcanetti.com/).

### Usage

I've included an example CSV in the project. Upload this to the demo and hit parse.

### To do

- Create option for multiple days
- Clean up styling
- Add favicon
- Split files into demo and src
- Only show file uploader if Webpack in development mode
